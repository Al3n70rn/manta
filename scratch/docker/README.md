These are docker image instructions and scripts associated with
issueing a conventional binary release of manta. As a rule of thumb,
these images use the oldest practical OS (for glibc compatibility)
with the newest practical compiler (for binary performance). These
images are not meant to assist users who want to run manta in docker.
