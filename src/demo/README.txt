This directory contains a small dateset which can be used to
verify correct installation and demonstrate the some basic
elements of the workflow. To run the demonstration, run the demo
script in the workflow installation bin directory:

"bash $INSTALL_DIR/bin/runMantaWorkflowDemo.bash"

The demo data contain reads from HCC1954/HCC1954BL in the vicinity
of the somatic translocation breakends corresponding to COSMIC
